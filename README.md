# PyCheckers
Made a text based Checkers game using Python

How to play:
Start off by chosing a board.  There are 2 included at the moment.  Simply type in a "1" or "2" when prompted to chose that board design.
In the future, we want the boards to be printed as a preview for the user to pick from.

Rules:
Player 1 is the "o" piece on the bottom and goes first.  Simply type in the coordinates (A1 through H8) that contains the piece you want to move and you will be given options on where to move it.  Pressing 1 will choose the first option printed on the left.  Upon completion of your move, it will be player 2's turn.  Taking a piece of yours to the enemy side will result in "kinging" your piece and will allow it to move both backwards and forewards.  Jumping is fully supported.  The first person to "jump" all of the enemy pieces wins.

Note:
This game runs in any python terminal by simply running the main() class from the terminal.
